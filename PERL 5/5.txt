#5. Write a Perl script to translate a text in English language to text in some other language. It
#should at least be able to generate something reasonable for the words: men, women, boys,
#girls, dreams, vision, little, become and with regardless of the context in which these words
#appear.

#For example:
#Enter a text: Little boys with dreams become men with vision
#Translated text: chika bsarang bksa jumang onga mchkma bksa noisit
#use strict; 

#Program:

my $str="Little boys with dreams become men with vision.\n";
print $str;
print "---------------\n";
print "English\n---------------\n";

$str =~ s/Little/chotte/g; 
$str =~ s/boys/ladake/g; 
$str =~ s/with/saath se/g; 
$str =~ s/dreams/sapane/g; 
$str =~ s/become/banana/g; 
$str =~ s/men/purushon/g; 
$str =~ s/vision/vijan/g; 

print $str;
print "---------------\n";
print "Hindi\n---------------\n";
